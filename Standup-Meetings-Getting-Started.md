# Standup Meetings - Getting Started

Stand-up Meeting is one of the two productivity-enhancing features of Probot. To gain maximum benefits, learn how the app works and ways to potentially increase the productivity of your team using this slackbot.

### Create a Slack Account
To use Probot, a Slack account is a must. All user profiles should be linked to the existing workspace profile on Slack. If your workspace profile is yet to be created, we recommend you to first 'Create Workspace'. Once it is done, create your individual Slack account and add to your workspace.

### Add Probot to Slack
Next step is adding Probot to Slack. Visit https://probot.ninja and hit the button which says “Add to Slack”. When you do this, Probot will be linked to your Slack account and be ready to use.  

### Create a Channel
Create a dedicated Slack channel where daily scrums would take place and assign a name. If you want to conduct daily stand-ups for more than one team, create multiple channels and follow the same procedure.

### Add Probot to Channel
Add Probot to the daily stand-up channel. To do this, you may either type ‘Probot Ninja’ in the ‘Send Invites To’ section while creating a channel or add the app later.

### Add People
To add members to the scrum channels, make sure they have existing Slack accounts linked to the workspace. If you want to add people when you are creating a channel, write their names in 'Send Invites To" section. You can always add more members from 'Invite More People' option on Slack.

## Customize Scrum Questions
~~By default, Probot will ask a pre-defined set of questions. Those are:~~

~~•	What did you do yesterday?~~

~~•	What will you do today?~~

~~•	Any roadblock.~~

~~If you want to add a different set of questions, overwrite the existing questions or ‘Add New Question’.~~

Always remember to save changes after modifying the sections.



[Pro Tip: Struggling to find scrum channels? Always create separate channels dedicated only to scrum meetings. Rename the channels with something relevant such as ‘scrum meetings’ or ‘daily stand-up’ so you can easily locate.]
