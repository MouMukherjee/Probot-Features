# Standup Meetings - Getting Started

Stand-up Meeting is one of the two productivity-enhancing features of Probot. To gain maximum benefits, learn how the app works and ways to potentially increase the productivity of your team using this slackbot.

### Create a Slack Account
To use Probot it is essential to have a Slack account. We always recommended you to first create a workspace profile. Once it is done, create individual user profiles on slack and add them to your workspace. 

### Add Probot to Slack
Next step is adding Probot to Slack. Visit https://probot.ninja and hit the button which says “Add to Slack”. When you do this, Probot will be linked to your Slack account and be ready to use.  

### Create a Channel
Create a dedicated Slack channel where daily scrums would take place and assign a name. If you want to conduct daily stand-ups for more than one team, create multiple channels and follow the same procedure.

### Add Probot to Channel
Add Probot to the daily stand-up channel. To do this, you may either type ‘Probot Ninja’ in the ‘Send Invites To’ section while creating a channel or add the app later.

### Add People
To add members to the scrum channels, make sure they have existing Slack accounts linked to the workspace. If you want to add people when you are creating a channel, write their names in 'Send Invites To" section. You can always add more members from 'Invite More People' option on Slack.

## Conducting a Stand-up
After the preliminary set-up is finished, you and your team are now ready to conduct virtual scrum. The actual process is initiated by typing this command- ‘scrum start’. As soon as a member writes this command in the channel, the daily stand-up meeting resumes. During a stand-up, Probot asks a set of questions to each active participant. 

## Customize Scrum Questions
~~By default, Probot will ask a pre-defined set of questions. Those are:~~

~~•	What did you do yesterday?~~

~~•	What will you do today?~~

~~•	Any roadblock.~~

~~If you want to add a different set of questions, overwrite the existing questions or ‘Add New Question’.~~

Always remember to save changes after modifying the sections.



[Pro Tip: Struggling to find scrum channels? Always create separate channels dedicated only to scrum meetings. Rename the channels with something relevant such as ‘scrum meetings’ or ‘daily stand-up’ so you can easily locate.]
