Probot is an exciting platform to share crisp project update and task reports. We understand that one size does not fit all. Keeping this in mind, our developers have enabled customization of the report format and others which we will learn today.

In order to help you customize your scrum channels, we have created editable sections. Taking maximum help from these features, you can enhance the productivity of your team and achieve project goals easily. 

To do so, access your Probot ‘Dashboard’ from the website. The dashboard consists of ‘Scrum’ and ‘Taskmail Reports’. Select ‘Scrum’ to view the names of all those channels Probot is linked to. Now select a channel which requires customization and go to ‘Settings’. Follow the same procedure for all other channels. 
 

Time Zone
Select a preferred time zone that you are team members follow. Proper time zone setting enables you to fetch appropriate scrum reports for a particular day. The scrum reports of the stand-up meeting responses are logged in the system. To view a particular user’s report for a given day, set the correct time zone in the settings. 


Sync Users
Added a new channel member? Quickly ‘Sync Users’ to reflect the name of the member under the ‘Users’ section so the member isn’t left out. In short, it brings the newly added channel members under the same roof, where they can either participate in daily stand-ups or receive scrum reports broadcasted on the channel. 

Permissions
Depending on the role of each channel member play in your team, you can set privileges. The section is divided into three categories- - ‘Attend Scrum’, ‘Send Digest mails’, and ‘Send Scrum Digest DM’. In this section, you can select or deselect participants for the daily stand-up, and authorize who should receive scrum digest mails and DM over the channel by activating or deactivating the toggle switches.

Scrum Questions
Use of Probot is not industry-specific. Starting from agile teams to architects and designers, Probot can be used in various places. Our main target is to get your job done with minimum iterations. 
Depending on the type of projects and role of the channels members, scrum questions may also vary. Which is why a question that is apt for an android app developer. To seek appropriate response and update on a project, edit the scrum questions. 
By default, Probot comes with a set of questions categorized under- ‘yesterday’ ‘today’, ‘roadblock and ‘none’. You may either edit, delete the existing questions or add absolutely new questions that are more suitable for your project.
