# Task Tracker: Reports

Task-Tracker is a project-based tool that helps to gain critical insight into your agile team’s improvement initiatives. With this tool, you can quickly create a list of high priority improvement initiatives so your team can effectively respond to the crisis with a better plan. In this article, we will learn how to generate project-based task reports within a blink of an eye. 

Task-Tracker brings you the most important project updates with the help of a set of questions that are designed to highlight progress and roadblocks. The process is demand-based so to save more time. When individual team members initiate the process and enter their response, Probot collects the information and shares in the form of taskmail reports with the project managers.

There are four different ways to retrieve a report:

## DM
Task tracking process takes place when a member sends a DM to Probot Ninja app in Slack. Each time a user submits task details and successfully registers the status update, Probot generates a task report which is to be shared exclusively with the member. As soon as the member finishes the steps by entering all task details, Probot shares a copy of the log with the user. 

## Via email
After a member submits task(s) by answering all the questions, the relevant recipients receive auto-generated emails from Probot. Otherwise known as task summary, the taskmail reports highlight the following information: task description, number of hours spent, remarks and present status. 

## Direct Search
Browsing the mailbox each time you are looking for a project report is demanding. With Task-Tracker, project managers can easily filter task reports from the dashboard for a specific date. Steps to conduct a direct search are:

•	Visit Probot’s main page and hit ‘Dashboard’. 

•	Select ‘Task-Tracker’ from the dashboard and go to ‘Reports’. 

•	Type the name of the user.

•	Mention the start and end date.

•	Click on ‘Go’. 

Probot will display the requested information from its database on the screen.

## Commands 
Steps to fetch reports are as follows:

•	To get taskmail report for a particular user for the current day, write- 
task report [@user].

•	To get a user's taskmail report for a particular date, write- 
task report [@user] [date].
